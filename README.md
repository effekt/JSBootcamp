# George Brown College - JavaScript Bootcamp

The George Brown College JavaScript Bootcamp will be run over the course of multiple 2 hour sessions to help refresh and further develop your knowledge of JavaScript. The overall goal is to prepare you for other courses taught based on ES languages (ECMAScript) such as TypeScript for COMP3132. All of the examples and content will be demonstrated with Node.js and VSCode (however you may use any IDE of preference).

The topics to cover may change without notice. DOM manipulation may or may not be covered depending on interest. The reasoning is that for future courses, DOM manipulation is handled quite differently than vanilla JavaScript, and what would be covered would not translate properly into Angular / React. The topics listed under each day may or may not be covered on the day it is listed as it solely depends on the overall understanding. Sessions may continue beyond the four weeks depending on the feedback.

Since the purpose of these sessions is to get everyone up to speed, we will not be covering more advanced topics such as Promises, Closures, Factories, etc. However, depending on interest we may continue these sessions beyond what's covered to delve deeper into more advanced topics.

Examples will be provided throughout the duration of these sessions with the possibility of some lab work and take-home practice. I will try to split the sessions into two parts, the first 1:00 - 1:15 covering the topics of the day, and the last 45 minutes going over some practical examples that bring all of the discussed topics together and answer any questions.
